            <h2>Lesson 12: Practice with Concatentate, Left, and Right Functions</h2>
            <p class="objective">Objective: Students practice applying functions for text such as concatentate, left, and right.</p>
            <p>If you take a look at the formula tab in Excel, one of the first things you notice are the categories of functions.  
                These categories group together functions that can be applied by date type.</p>
            <p>Under the <strong>"text"</strong>category, you will find <strong>concatenate, left, and right</strong>functions amoung
            others. All of these functions are to be used with text such as "Adam" or "Pancake".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Concatentate: means to "join". This will join the data in two cells. For instance, if A1 "Joe" and A2 "Smith"
                    are concatenated in cell A3, the output is "JoeSmith".  To add a space you MUST include a space in the function.</li>
                <li>Left:  This functions displays the left most characters in a cell.  For instance if cell A1, states "Key Largo" and we use Left to 
                    display the 3 left most characters, the output woud be: Key .  A space (though invisible) is a character!</li>
                <li>Right: This is the opposite of "left".  The function will display the right most characters. You tell Excel how many characters to display.</li>
            </ul>
