            <h2>Lesson 13: Working with Tables In Excel</h2>
            <p class="objective">Objective: Students will be able to convert data to a table and apply styling to the table design.</p>
            <p>Converting your data into a table gives users powerful sorting and filtering tools.</p>
            <p>Imagine if you had to control the store inventory for Walmart.  Think of the thousands of products and prices you
                would have to keep track of for sales and restocking!  Using tables in Excel would give you the power of eliminating data so you only 
                analyze the most important cells.</p>
            <p>In this video, you will learn how to convert data to a table.  Convert a table back to a range of data and apply formatting to your table.</p>
