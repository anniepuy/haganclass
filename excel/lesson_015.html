            <h2>Lesson 14: Working with SUM Functions and Formulas in Excel</h2>
            <p class="objective">Objective: Students will be able knowledge of basic mathmatical operations to create formulas in Excel and determine when it is appropriate
                to utilize Functions for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>What is the difference between these two statements?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>=SUM(A3:A4)</li>
                <li>=A3 + A4</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you answered that the first one is a FUNCTION and the second line is a FORMULA you are correct!  Both complete
                the addition operation. The only difference is the FUNCTION can handle a range of numbers from different worksheets easier then a formula.</p>
           
            <p>In this video, you will get practice using basic formulas and functions.</p>
