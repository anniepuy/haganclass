            <p class="objective">Objective: Students will practice using formatting tools such as Sparklines to enhance data in an Excel worksheet.</p>
            <p>We already know that Excel has powerful functions which allow a user to add numbers quickly.  Excel is the powerhouse that create wonderful charts for us to display our data.
                Just in case we don't need to create a whole chart, Excel comes with mini visuals called Sparklines that help show trends in data.  Trends is the change in something overtime.  For businesses, we can see trends if we are making a larger profit (gross) or loosing money. Sparklines show us these trends.</p>
