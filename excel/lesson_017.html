            <h2>Lesson 17: Working with Functions for Business</h2>
            <p class="objective">Objective: Students will use functions in Excel to determine NET Income and Profit Margin.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are two business terms, or vocabulary words, you need to know for the MOS 2016 exam.</p>
            <p><strong>NET INCOME: </strong> is Net Sales minus Net costs.  The word NET means <strong>total</strong> minus expenses.</p>
            <p><strong>PROFIT MARGIN:</strong> is the income made by a company after expenses, displayed as a percentage.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, do not stress over these terms. Just be familar with them and break down which mathmatical operation the question is asking you
                to perform.
            </p>
