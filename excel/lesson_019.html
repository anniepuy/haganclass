            <h2>Lesson 19: Using CountIF Functions to Analyze Data</h2>
            <p class="objective">Objective: will apply knowledge of "IF" functions and apply it to the functions of COUNTIF.</p>
            
            <p>IF Functions have three main parts that are required:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Logical Test: A reference cell is tested against an inequality such as equal to, less than, or greater than.</li>
                <li>Value if True: If the referenced cell MATCHES the test, what will Excel return.</li>
                <li>Value if False: If the referenced cell DOES NOT MATCH the test, what will Excel return.</li>
            </ul>

            
            <p>The COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, and SUMIF functions are speficif IF functions that use the <strong>same</strong> three
            parts as a regular IF.  The difference is that COUNTIF will only count the cell entries that match the test.  SUMIF will
        only add the cell values that match true to the logical test, and AVERAGEIF will only average cell data that match the logical test.</p>
           
            <p>In this video, you will get practice the COUNTIF function.</p>
